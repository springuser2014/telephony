Hi!

That's my personal project on university classes,
so be careful while you use it for your own.

It's very experimental and I am just a student ;-)

It's quite simple app for managing products in electronic products store.

Main features included: 
- Managing products in stores
- Managing stores, users (admins, workers), credentials
- Managing deliveries, sales and reclamations

Used tech stuff:
- Google web Toolkit 2.5
- SmartGWT 3.0
- Restlet 2.1
- Maven 2
- JPA 2.0 (Hibernate 3.5)
- Guice 3.0
- GWT-platform 0.7
- Flyway 1.7

Project is now under heavy development, in next few weeks there will appear:
- Unit tests
- UI archtecture improvement
- Many new features including authentication (Apache Shiro), mailing (JavaMail) and others.

Stay tuned!

Cheers 
Paul

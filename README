Hi!

That's my personal project on university classes,
so be careful while you use it for your own.

It's very experimental and I am just a student ;-)

It's quite simple app for managing products in electronic store.

Used tech stuff:
- Google web Toolkit 2.4
- SmartGWT 3.0
- Gilead 1.3.1
- Maven 2
- JPA 2.0 (Hibernate 3.5)
- Guice 3.0

Project is now under havily development, in next few weeks there will appear:
- Unit tests
- Mvp4g integration
- UI archtecture improvement
- Many new features including authentication (Apache Shiro), mailing (JavaMail) and others.

Stay tuned!

Cheers 
Paul
